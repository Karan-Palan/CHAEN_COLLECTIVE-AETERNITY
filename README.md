# CHAEN COLLECTIVE (Archived)

> **Note**: This project is now archived as the Aeternity JavaScript SDK has some updates, and I won't be updating the codebase.

## Project Status: Archived

This repository has been archived as the Aeternity JavaScript SDK is no longer maintained. The codebase remains available for historical reference and educational purposes, but no further updates or maintenance will be provided.

## Original Project Overview

CHAEN COLLECTIVE was designed to empower users in the efficient management of investment clubs on the Aeternity blockchain. The platform provided various functionalities for collaborative investment management in a decentralized manner.

### Key Features (Historical)

- **Club Creation**: Users could create investment clubs with custom parameters
- **Membership Management**: Join/leave functionality for club members
- **Pool Contributions**: Members could contribute AE coins to a shared fund
- **Proposal System**: Members could create and vote on investment proposals
- **Decentralized Governance**: Transparent voting and fund management

## Why Archived?

This project was built using the Aeternity JavaScript SDK, which is no longer maintained. Without active SDK support, the application cannot function as intended on the Aeternity blockchain.

## Alternative Solutions

If you're interested in building a similar application, you might want to explore:

1. Other blockchain platforms with active development communities
2. Updated SDKs and tooling for decentralized application development
3. Modern frameworks for building Web3 applications
